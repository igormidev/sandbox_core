# Sandbox Core
A powerful tool for handling API requests and caching. Whether for normal `RestFull` requests, or for requests from `Firebase`, sandbox_core will help you `make requests`, `handle errors`, `cache data` and `print` them to the console in development.

## Getting started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  sandbox_core:
